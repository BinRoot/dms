# About

Join the [W3C Conversational Interfaces Community Group](https://conversational-interfaces.github.io).

The mission is to enable web developers, content writers, and AI researchers to collaborate and share conversational experiences. Most dialogue systems serve interactive experiences in their own domain specific and often proprietary language, causing a fragmented zoo of formats. For example, Google Home or Alexa do not share a common intermediate representation, which makes writing wide-spread content inaccessible to the mass audience. We study existing specs for authoring dialogue and design standards to harness proven techniques into common agreement. The charter may be found here: https://conversational-interfaces.github.io/charter/.
